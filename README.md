# ‚òÑÔ∏è Dotfiles üñ•

Each line of configuration is simple, stripping away the unnecessary to leave only what matters. Minimalistic and essential, these dotfiles are without using too many plugins/frameworks in all the tools and try to make it simple. It's not about adding more; it's about needing less.

## Manage

I use [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) for managing my dotfiles. Follow these [instructions](https://jerrynsh.com/how-to-manage-dotfiles-with-chezmoi/) for add or changing any configuration.

I followed the instructions from [XDG_Base_Directory](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory) for clean my dotfiles and manage config directories.
