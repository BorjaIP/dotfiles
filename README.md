# ‚òÑÔ∏è Dotfiles üñ•

## Manage

I use the [git bare repository](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) method for managing my dotfiles.

I followed the instructions from [XDG_Base_Directory](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory) for clean my dotfiles and manage config directories.

## Contents

This config repo is designed for Manjaro Linux based on Arch Linux.
